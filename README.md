# LiveStuffPlusDisplay

This project aims to provide a live Stuff+ display, taking directly from the Trackman API to show Stuff+ live during a bullpen or game. The project utilizes a raspberry pi hooked up to a monitor. The user has the option to input whether the stand-in batter is a lefty or righty during the bullpen or game, which factors into an individualized variable in the model. The pi grabs the API from the Trackman unit and runs a pitch grade model using 7 variables, release speed, spin rate, spin axis, horizontal movement, vertical movement, release height, and release side. This xRV model has a RMSE of .2111. Using this model, the apache host site runs, displaying a concise number for the Stuff+ for the pitcher to view. In this example, I provided a demo for inputting pitch characteristics, as my in class demonstration did not include a trackman unit or a Division 1 caliber Pitcher.
